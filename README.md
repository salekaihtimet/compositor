# compositor
A patch for Pure Data for easier composing.

It sorts scales and stuff and prints them out in different styles. Also, basic sequencing is involved. Some intersequential comparitions also. 

The patch is in finnish. The relevant parts are obvious to people who know their modal theory.

This patch requires the following patches in addition to pd-vanilla. They all are in pd-extended.
list-abs
zexy
ggee (for serialize)
flatspace (for demux)
ext13 (for ftos)

Thanks to people who created them!
