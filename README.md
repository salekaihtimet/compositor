# compositor
A patch for Pure Data for easier composing. Uses 12-tone scales and relies on modal theory.

Sorts scales and stuff and prints them out in various styles. 

Basic sequencing is involved with some intersequential comparing. 

The patch is in finnish for now. The relevant parts are obvious to people who know their modal theory.

The following patches are required in addition to pd-vanilla. They all are in pd-extended.
- list-abs
- zexy
- ggee (for serialize)
- flatspace (for demux)
- ext13 (for ftos)

Thanks to people who created them!
